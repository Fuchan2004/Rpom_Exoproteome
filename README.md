## Abstract
Nitrogen-rich proteinaceous compounds are a key component of surface and upper mesopelagic particulate organic matter, and their rapid degradation by heterotrophic bacteria is an important process in releasing bioavailable nitrogen when other nitrogen containing substrates are deficient. Heterotrophs encode a wide variety of hydrolytic enzymes and nutrient transporters, which provide them with the ability to sustain nutrient stresses and inhabit protein-rich niche habitats such as sinking or suspended particles. Despite their important contribution to the oceanic nitrogen cycle, and marine biogeochemical cycles, the exact protein-level response of heterotrophic bacteria to nitrogen limitation in these environments remains unknown. In this study, *Ruegeria pomeroyi* strain DSS-3, a coastal marine heterotrophic bacterium, served as model organism to investigate the shift in protein production and secretion upon nitrogen limitation in the presence of extracellular protein. We tie these observations to extracellular protease rates determined from a fluorescence-based proteolysis assay. Our analyses reveal an increase in extracellular protease activity due to increased transport of these enzymes through the type 1 secretion system into the periplasmic and extracellular space, in response to nitrogen deficiency in DSS-3. Increased amino acid and oligopeptide uptake capabilities as well as higher abundance of amino acid dehydrogenases in the intracellular proteome further highlight this alternative process heterotrophic bacteria employ to challenge nitrogen limitation. Our study contributes to a better understanding of adaptation strategies of marine heterotrophic bacteria to protein-rich and nitrogen-limited niches, such as sinking and suspended particulate organic matter.
